# Task
    I was given a mock-up from a company to fix their codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their website is optimized for search engines. 

# Fixed 
    in HTML:
        Re-named some classes in the code to help organize the code.
    In CSS:
        added a root: directory for the colors in the code to help whoever is working on the code in the future.
